                        local partners are running an open data challenge on the theme of Responsive Cities. The specific
                        challenge questions for each city are described in the tabs below and you can <a
                                href="#enter" class="page-scroll"> ENTER</a> your proposal by 21 October 2016.</p>
                    <p>The aim of the Responsive Cities challenge is to encourage developers, designers, researchers and
                        entrepreneurs to use available open data from various cities across South Africa to develop
                        applications, stories and visualisations that can help residents work better with local
                        government.</p>
                    <p>Between September and November 2016, participants will have a chance to work with city representatives,
                        technical mentors, other teams and ODI specialists to build out their value proposition and workable
                        prototypes. Winners will receive cash awards, incubation and/or seed funding up to R300,000 to
                        develop their solutions further.</p>

                        <p>South Africa was one of the founding members of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) when it
                            was formally launched in 20 September 2011, and has made a number of commitments that seek
                            to build on existing government and citizen-led initiatives related to open government in
                            the country. From the South African perspective, OGP commitments must be aligned to the five
                            year national priorities which are, in turn, linked to the targets identified in the NDP and
                            which are derived from the assessment of South Africa’s achievement of the national vision
                            as stipulated in the Constitution. That is the achievement of a non-racial, non sexist,
                            united, democratic South Africa.</p>

                        <p>The Open Data Institute (ODI) was co-founded in 2012 by the inventor of the web Sir Tim
                            Berners-Lee and AI expert Sir Nigel Shadbolt to address today’s global challenges using the
                            web of data. We bring together commercial and non-commercial organisations and governments
                            around specific sectors to address today’s global challenges. Driven by needs, and focused
                            on timely challenges, we help people identify and address how the web of data will impact
                            their businesses and their sectors. Together, we will build a strong data infrastructure
                            that delivers open innovation at web-scale.</p>
                        <p>ODI’s involvement in the Responsive Cities Challenge is enabled by Open Data for Development
                            (OD4D), a program which brings together a network of leading implementing partners who have
                            a wealth of experience in developing countries. Together, they are harnessing open data
                            initiatives to enhance transparency and accountability, and to facilitate public service
                            delivery and citizen participation. The goal of the OD4D program is to scale innovations
                            that are working, and to strengthen coordination among other open data initiatives to ensure
                            they benefit people in developing countries.</p>

                        <p>We love data. We live it, eat it, drink it and dream about it. We believe that data
                            (especially government data) should be open. Not just for personal use. Data should be
                            shareable, mash-able, available for commercial use. Our goal is to promote the release of
                            data under an open data licence to make it available to everyone who wants it.</p>

                        <p>The Centre for Public Service Innovation (CPSI) was established in 2001 by the Minister for
                            Public Service and Administration. In 2008 it was re-launched as the first Government
                            Component to be established in terms of the Public Service act as amended in 2007. The CPSI
                            is mandated to develop innovative, sustainable and responsive models for improved service
                            delivery. The work of the CPSI is guided by an understanding of innovation in a public
                            sector context as “the creation and implementation of new and service delivery solutions
                            (systems, processes, methods, models, products and services) resulting in significant
                            improvements in outcomes, efficiency, effectiveness and quality”.</p>
